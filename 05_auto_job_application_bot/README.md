This project demonstrates **automated job scraping and simulated applications using Selenium**. It scrapes job listings from a fake jobs site, saves the data into a CSV file, and simulates clicking the "Apply" button for each job.

### Features

- Scrape job title, company, location, posting date, and application link.
- Save all scraped job data into `jobs.csv`.
- Automatically visit each job's "Apply" link to simulate applications.
- Print status messages for each applied job.
- Close the browser after completing the process.
